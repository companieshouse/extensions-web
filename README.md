# extensions-web

### Setting up Githooks

Run `make githooks` to configure your local project clone to use the hooks located in the `.githooks` directory.

## Debugging in VSCode
If running in vscode modify the `.vscode/launch.json` to attach your debugger to the process running on the chs-dev vagrant box
```
{
  configurations: [
    {
      "name": "Debug extensions-web",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "restart": true,
      "port": 9922,
      "address": "chs-dev",
      "remoteRoot": "/home/vagrant/SingleService/extensions-web",
      "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
    . . .
  ]
}
```

modify your [nodemon.json](./nodemon.json) file to "inspect" the debug port 9922 (_this is just a random port I have chosen for this example that will be available on chs-dev_)
```
"exec": "node -r ts-node/register --inspect=0.0.0.0:9922 ./src/bin/www.ts"
```

Click on the Debug button on the left pane of vscode and select "Debug extensions-web", after clicking the play button you should be in debug mode and your break points will be hit.
