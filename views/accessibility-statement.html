      <p>This service is run by
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house">Companies House</a>. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text disappearing off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ve also made the website text simple to understand.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this service is</h2>
      <p>We know some parts of this service aren’t fully accessible:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a timeout is present without indication to users</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you can’t access parts of this service</h2>
      <p>For the welfare of our staff during the COVID-19 outbreak, our telephone contact centre is now closed. You can still email your queries to enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reporting accessibility problems with this service</h2>

      <p>We are continuing to improve the accessibility of this service. Contact us if you have accessibility requirements that are not listed on this page.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we
        respond to your complaint,
        <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>
      <p>Companies House is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
      <p>This service is partially compliant with the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>
        AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
      <p>A timeout is present without indication to users. This fails WCAG 2.2.6 success criterion (timeouts). We plan to fix this by June 2020.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested this service</h2>
      <p>We regularly carry out internal tests for compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines V2.1 level A and level AA using a variety of manual and automated testing tools.</p>
      <p>This service was last (externally) audited on 5 November 2019. The audit was carried out by the
        <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre</a>.</p>
      <p>We tested all the screens from start page to confirmation screen.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
